STORY

The mayor of Tall Oak convened an emergency town meeting in the common hall of the inn.
News from recent caravans told that the Northern Empire was sending scouting
parties, looking to open trade routes with the merchant citadels on the other side
of the great forest. That meant sooner or later, the Empire was likely to send troops
to the village of Tall Oak and turn their quiet community into an Imperial outpost. 

The mayor asked for volunteers to meet the enemy threat up the road. The Sword Hero
stepped forth immediately and rode to battle the next morning. By afternoon, their horse
rode back to the village alone, it was clear the Hero had been outnumbered by bandits and
had fallen. The Mage Hero stepped up and swore to save the village. Onlookers said the
Hero's magic stood no chance against the constant rain of arrows from Imperial archers.
The general feeling was that the life they had known and loved was doomed. There were 
some able-bodied workers who could learn to hold a sword, but no one to train them or
drill them in tactics. 

"I'll raise a force." It was that mysterious nerd who spent every night in the upstairs
room of the tavern, pushing painted wooden figurines around a felt-covered table. Jeers
and rude laughter filled the hall. "I'm serious. Sure I've never swung a sword but I know
this valley and these people better than anybody. I've studied tactics and history and
anatomy and economics and psychology. I know how to bring people together." The
mysterious nerd punctuated this by tossing a jangling leather coin pouch in the air.

TAVERN HERO is an autobattler / RTS / tower defense inspired game with combat mechanics
based on the D20 tabletop ruleset. The eponymous hero is a command unit who summons forth
rabble onto the battlefield to fight some hostiles. 

Arrow keys move Tavern Hero.
Space key calls forth a fighter. This is a randomly generated 1st level D20 fighter.
You can mouseover a character for a status line at the top of the screen:

"Name [ HP ] STR DEX CON"

The STR/DEX/CON numbers shown the ability mods (0 or +2 etc.) but stats are rolled
3d6 in order internally. 

Combat loosely follows D20 conventions, units act in initiative order and attacks have
to-hit and damage rolls modified by the appropriate stat.
